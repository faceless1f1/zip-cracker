# zip-cracker

A Python-based brute-force tool for cracking AES-encrypted zip files. This script leverages multi-threading to speed up the password cracking process using different wordlists. It supports several wordlists and includes an option for verbose output.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Processing:** Uses a thread pool to attempt multiple passwords simultaneously.
- **GPU Acceleration (CUDA):** Supports GPU-based password cracking for faster execution (if a CUDA-capable GPU is available).
- **Multiple Wordlists:** Choose between human-only, common-password-win, or rockyou wordlists.
- **Interactive File Viewer:** Upon finding the correct password, an interactive session allows you to browse and view files within the archive.
- **Graphical Tree Display:** Uses the `rich` library to display a neat, colored tree of the archiveâ€™s directory structure.
- **Graceful Interrupt:** Stops all threads cleanly when a password is found or on user interruption.
- **Verbose Mode:** Option to print each failed attempt for better traceability.
- **Variable Multithreading:** Determines the optimal amount of threads to run on the user's machine. It also allows the user to override this.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **pyzipper:** For handling AES encrypted zip files.
- **rich:** For enhanced console output and tree visualization.
- **numba & CUDA:** For GPU acceleration (optional, requires an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA drivers).

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyzipper, rich, numba
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faceless1f1/zip-cracker.git
    cd zip-cracker
    ```

2. Ensure that your wordlists (`rockyou.txt`, `passwords.txt`, and `common-passwords-win.txt`) are in the same directory or update the paths accordingly.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line by specifying the zip file to attack and choosing a wordlist option:

```bash
python zip-cracker.py -f path/to/yourfile.zip [options]
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- **`-f`**: Path to the zip file (required).
- **`-v`**: Verbose mode. Prints each incorrect password attempt.
- **`-p`**: Use the password wordlist (`passwords.txt`).
- **`-w`**: Use the common-password-win wordlist (`common-passwords-win.txt`).
- **`-l`**: Use a custom wordlist
- **`-t`**: Set threads manually
- **`-g`**: Use GPU acceleration (if available).

If neither `-p` nor `-w` is provided, the tool defaults to using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

### Examples

- Use the rockyou wordlist (default):

    ```bash
    python zip-cracker.py -f secret.zip
    ```

- Use the human-only wordlist in verbose mode:

    ```bash
    python zip-cracker.py -f secret.zip -p -v
    ```

- Use the common-password-win wordlist:

    ```bash
    python zip-cracker.py -f secret.zip -w
    ```
## Output
The -t flag is not necessary here but it will make the program run on 8 threads regardless what the program calculates as the optimal amount of threads.

python zip-cracker.py -f secret.zip -w -t 8

## Code Overview

- **`try_password`**: Attempts to open the zip file with a given password.
- **`process_wordlist`**: Reads the wordlist file and dispatches multiple threads to try each password.
- **`process_wordlist_gpu`**: Uses GPU parallel processing for password cracking (if supported).
- **`main`**: Handles command-line argument parsing and triggers the password cracking process.
