# zip-cracker

A Python-based brute-force tool for cracking AES-encrypted zip files. This script leverages multi-threading to speed up the password cracking process using different wordlists. It supports several wordlists and includes an option for verbose output.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Processing:** Uses a thread pool to attempt multiple passwords simultaneously.
- **Multiple Wordlists:** Choose between human-only, common-password-win, or rockyou wordlists.
- **Graceful Interrupt:** Stops all threads cleanly when a password is found or on user interruption.
- **Verbose Mode:** Option to print each failed attempt for better traceability.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **pyzipper:** For handling AES encrypted zip files.

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyzipper
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zip-bruteforce-tool.git
    cd zip-bruteforce-tool
    ```

2. Ensure that your wordlists (`rockyou.txt`, `passwords.txt`, and `common-passwords-win.txt`) are in the same directory or update the paths accordingly.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line by specifying the zip file to attack and choosing a wordlist option:

```bash
python script.py -f path/to/yourfile.zip [options]
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- **`-f`**: Path to the zip file (required).
- **`-v`**: Verbose mode. Prints each incorrect password attempt.
- **`-p`**: Use the password wordlist (`passwords.txt`).
- **`-w`**: Use the common-password-win wordlist (`common-passwords-win.txt`).

If neither `-p` nor `-w` is provided, the tool defaults to using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

### Examples

- Use the rockyou wordlist (default):

    ```bash
    python script.py -f secret.zip
    ```

- Use the human-only wordlist in verbose mode:

    ```bash
    python script.py -f secret.zip -p -v
    ```

- Use the common-password-win wordlist:

    ```bash
    python script.py -f secret.zip -w
    ```

## Code Overview

- **`try_password`**: Attempts to open the zip file with a given password.
- **`process_wordlist`**: Reads the wordlist file and dispatches multiple threads to try each password.
- **`main`**: Handles command-line argument parsing and triggers the password cracking process.
